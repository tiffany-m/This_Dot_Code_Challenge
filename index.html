Minimum Requirements
Use https://github.com/search as a reference for functionality, but feel free to change style, behavior, and features as you see fit and time permitting. It is not necessary to match the actual design of GitHub and we are not expecting a professional design. Focus on functionality and code.
As a user,
● I can search for users and see a paginated (the act or process of putting numbers on the pages of a book) list of results
● I can navigate through the next and previous pages of the paginated results
● I see the total count of search results
● I see notable information for each search result, such as the description, star/follower count, profile pictures, etc.
● I can select a search result and be taken to the applicable page on github.com API
